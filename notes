# Reflection – 2025-05-05  
_Theme: Tonal Intimacy & Whispered Emotion_
**What worked**  
- Microprompt delivered intimacy through slow breath pacing  
- Silence between words enhanced emotional absorption
**What to improve**  
- Voice tone flattened mid-sentence—try subtle pitch decay  
- Reverb tail was too long in the final half
**Next steps**  
- Test 'warm constraint' micro-line phrasing  
- Try tighter fades on silence to preserve intimacy
